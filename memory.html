            <p>To my love,</p>
            <p>As I sit here thinking about us, I realize just how much every memory we’ve created together means to me. From the quiet moments where we shared a knowing glance, to the adventures that filled our hearts with excitement, each memory has its own special place in my heart.
            
                But as much as I want to shout to the world how much I cherish these moments, I know that some things are too precious to be shared with anyone else. Our memories, our little secrets, our laughter, our love—they’re sacred, and they belong only to you and me. They’re ours to hold onto, to relive in the moments we’re apart, and to treasure for a lifetime.
                
                So while I can’t share every single one of these moments in public, please know that every single one is engraved deep in my heart. Thank you for all the beautiful memories we’ve created together, and I can’t wait to make many more with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With all my love, <br>
                    Shohan</p>
